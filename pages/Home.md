# Team17 AI Analytics

At Team17 AI Analytics, we specialize in providing cutting-edge AI-powered solutions for comprehensive company clustering and market segmentation. Leveraging advanced techniques such as kernel PCA (Principal Component Analysis) and t-SNE (t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding), we offer businesses in Saarland an unparalleled insight into their industry landscape.

## Our Approach

By harnessing the power of state-of-the-art transformers, we embed company descriptions into high-dimensional representations, enabling us to identify hidden patterns and similarities. Through our innovative clustering methodology, we analyze these embeddings and provide businesses with a holistic view of companies sharing similar characteristics based on their descriptions.
