Saarstahl,"The locations of Saarstahl AG not only have a long tradition but have also contributed to the shaping of the creation of history in the region. The Neunkirchen plant was mentioned as early as 1593. This makes it Saarstahl AG's location with the richest in tradition and, at the same time, it is even the oldest steelmaking location in Germany that is still active today. Burbach and Völklingen are both younger, having been founded in 1856 and 1873 as part of the increasing industrialisation of Germany. Each of the three steelworks then rapidly developed and, during the 20th century, they rose to become renowned large-scale enterprises with several thousand employees. In the 1970s, it started to make sense to combine forces. The current locations merged to a company that has had the name Saarstahl AG since 1989 and has made a name for itself as a global manufacturer of long products."
